ShortAnswer part of HW05 --Glen

1) If you pass a two dimmensional array to a function that takes a two dimmensional array 
as an argument, you have to specify the dimmensions of that array at compile time.
**However, the same program could not handle images of any other size.

2) You could use either of the following: 1) a Flat Array; or 2) the Numerical Recipes Trick,
where you use two arrays--first create a flat array, and then you make an array of pointers 
where each pointer in the array points to the start of a row in the flat array.

3) My computer is little endian.

	I created and ran this code called "bittles.cpp", which I uploaded to git hw05:

#include <cstdio>

int main(int argv, char** argc) {

	int n = 123456;
	unsigned char* bittles = (unsigned char*)(&n);
	
	printf("%x %x %x %x\n", (int) bittles[0],(int) bittles[1],
				(int) bittles[2],(int) bittles[3]);

	
	if(bittles[0] > bittles[3]) {
		printf("You have a little-endian machine.");
	} else 
		printf("You have a big-endian manchine.");
}


The output was: 
40 e2 1 0
You have a little-endian machine.
