ShortAnswer part of HW05 --Glen

1) If you pass a two dimmensional array to a function that takes a two dimmensional array 
as an argument, you have to specify the dimmensions of that array at compile time.
**However, the same program could not handle images of any other size.

2) You could use either of the following: 1) a Flat Array; or 2) the Numerical Recipes Trick,
where you use two arrays--first create a flat array, and then you make an array of pointers 
where each pointer in the array points to the start of a row in the flat array.

3) My computer is little endian.

4) Completed last programming assignment for reading and writing PPM files with a flat array.
