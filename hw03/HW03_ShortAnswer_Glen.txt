1. What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

int min;
for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {

	int value;
	scanf("%d", &value);
	if(i=0) min = value;
	else if(value<min) min = value;
	
} // end of loop over input

printf("The smallest or the 10 values you entered was %d\n", min);

	***After Line 4 and before Line 5, no printf statement to ask the user to enter an integer,
	which would then be scanned in and assigned to the variable value in Line 5. 
	***Line 6, the code if(i=0) should read if(i==0)
	***Missing {} after the if statement and after the elseif statement which would include
	the min = value; code inside each.
	***Line 11, inside the printf statement, the word "or" should probably be "of" to make sense

2. What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

int* pointerToMax(int a, int b) {
	if(a>b) return &a;
	else return &b;
}

	***Move the RETURN statements out of the {} that follow the function,
	since now the result is only local to the function
	***Both the if and else statements are missing their {}
	which would include the return statments inside each

3. What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

int* ptr = NULL;
scanf("%d", ptr);
printf("You entered %d", &ptr)

	***In the second line, scanf("%d", ptr); should read, scanf("%d", &ptr);  thus ptr becomes &ptr
	   In the third line, &ptr should read *ptr
	
	***Since I don't know what code came before this snippet, other possible issues could be that
	 the coder hasn't allocated memory into the pointer (NULL) or declared a variable for a value, or
	 asked the user (via a printf command) to enter a value...

4. Describe what each of the following declare:
(a) int* a;
		This declares a variable that holds a printer
(b) const int b;
		This declares a variable to a const int
(c) const int* c;
		This declares a pointer to a const int
(d) int* const d;
		This declares a const pointer to an int
(e) const int* const e;
		This delares a const pointer to a const int
		
5. What is the difference between the * and & operators?

	The "*" dereferences a pointer (returns the data),
	whereas the "&", as in "&a", returns a pointer to the data in variable a.

6. What is the difference between const int* a and int* const b?

	The "const int* a" declares a pointer to const int,
	whereas "int* const b" declares const pointer to int.
