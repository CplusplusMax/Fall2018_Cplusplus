1. What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?

void swap(int* a, int* b) {
int* tmp = a;
a = b;
b = tmp;
} // end of swap method


	// Cannot assign a value to a pointer (should have int* tmp = &a;
	//  and then dereference the pointer to the value later ( b = *tmp)
	
	
2. What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?

char copy[8];
const char* string = "hello";
for(int i=0; string[i] != ’\0’; ++i) {
copy[i] = string[i];
}
printf("%s\n", copy);

	// Since string is assigned as a pointer to a const char, you cannot assign it to 
	//     a non const  (i.e.  copy[i] = string[i])
	// To fix it, change to (char* string) ... (or make copy a const)
	//    also of note, copy has a length of 8, whereas "hello" is only a length of 5 plus
	//     the "\0"

3. Suppose you have a function that takes an array as an argument in the usual way, which is
declared as:

void f(int* array, int length);

Suppose you also have an array declared as:

int a[128];

How would you pass a sub-array containing only the third through sixth elements of a to the
function f?

	//  you would write   f(a+2, 3)



4. What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

double* allocateArray(int length) {
double array[length];
return array;
}

	// the function requires two arguments (array, length); this is missing the array
	// to fix, just add the array in the parenthesis (type array, int length)


5. What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?

char string[5];
string[0] = ’h’;
string[1] = ’e’;
string[2] = ’l’;
string[3] = ’l’;
string[4] = ’o’;
printf("%s\n", string);

	// there should be a length of 6, as the string "hello" also includes a "\0"
	//  to fix, change to  char string[6];
