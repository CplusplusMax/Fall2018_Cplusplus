1. What does the "friend" keyword do?

		It lets a class grant special access to external functions, such as overloading
	the << operator to make your own objects printable.

2. Why should you never use "using namespace std;" ?

		If two people use the same package name, they will have naming collisions; therefore,
	if you put it in a header file, you will import the namespace in any C++ file that
	includes that header, which will remove your ability to use that namespace to avoid
	naming collisions.
	
3. Describe four ways to return an object from a method.

	1) You could return a reference to a class member; but everytime you call the method, 
		it returns the same object.
	2) You could return a copy of an object; but this creates a copy, and leads to
		inefficient code.
	3) You could return an object created on the heap; but you are forcing the caller to
		deal with heap data and the memory management that comes with it, also it is 
		allocating fresh memory every time you call it.
	4) You could use an argument to pass a non-const reference to an existing object,
	    which the method modifies.  (and return nothing..."void")  Best method described,
		(but will not work if the object does not have methods that let you set it to the
		desired state).

4. What does the "mutable" keyword do?

		The mutable keyword makes class members (variables only) that can be modified
	inside a const method.  So instead of nothing being able to be modified because
	you used a const method, this allows specified variable to be modified.

5. What are the three ways a class can contain objects in C++?

	1) As actual objects
	2) As a reference
	3) As a pointer

6. What is a Singleton?

		A Singleton is a class that can only ever have one instance.
