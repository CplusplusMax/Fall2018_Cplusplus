Short Answer for HW06  Glen Schmeling

1) What are libraries good for?

	Libraries allow you to link to the library (a collection of .o files)
	instead of having to link to each individual object file.
	
2) What are the two types of libraries and how are they different?

	The two types of libraries are "Static" libraries and "Shared Object" libraries.
	
	When you link to a "Static" library, its object files become part of the executable, 
	just like the individual .o files, but they make the size of the executable larger.
	
	A "Shared object" library remains separate from the executable, and the machine code
	is loaded by the executable at runtime, so a single library can be used by several
	different executables.
